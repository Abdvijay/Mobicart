üìå Project Description ‚Äì MobiCart

MobiCart is a mobile shopping website developed as part of my undergraduate coursework. The project was built and tested on a dual-core system using older-generation tools available at that time. Due to compatibility constraints, the project is optimized to run on a specific environment using an earlier version of Mozilla Firefox. It supports essential e-commerce features like user account management, product display, add-to-cart, order processing, and basic admin control.

üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

1. Mozilla Firefox (Older Version)
   The project was tested and runs best on an earlier version of Mozilla Firefox, which ensured proper rendering of styles and compatibility with older JavaScript and PHP methods.

2. WAMPServer 3.0
   WAMPServer provides the Apache, PHP, and MySQL environment needed to run MobiCart locally. Version 3.0 was used to match PHP version compatibility and manage the MySQL database for storing user, product, and order data.

3. Sublime Text
   Sublime Text was the code editor used during development for writing and managing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code. Its lightweight nature and syntax highlighting helped improve coding efficiency.
